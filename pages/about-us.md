  **Florent Teichteil-Königsbuch** is an expert in AI Decision-Making and Combinatorial Optimization
  in Airbus Central Research and Technology. After graduating as a PhD in Artificial Intelligence from the University
  of Toulouse and SUPAERO in 2005, he worked in ONERA as a research scientist in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence
  from 2005 to 2015. He then joined Airbus as a senior data scientist and
  research project leader working on bringing decision-making research to various industrial aerospace use cases.
  He has published several conference and journal papers on AI decision-making and autonomous robotics.
  He is collaborating with [ANITI](https://aniti.univ-toulouse.fr/en/) on combinatorial optimization topics, and is also coordinating
  the industrial integration of the research conducted in the European Project [TUPLES](https://tuples.ai/) on Trustworthy
  Decision-Making. Florent is one of the main contributors of the scikit-decide library, especially
  working on the C++ core functions and on the classical planning and search engines.<br>

  **Alexandre Arnold** is an AI Senior Research Scientist working at Airbus Central Research and Technology
  in the Artificial Intelligence domain. He is an expert in Reinforcement Learning
  (an Automated Decision Making technique) and has also been involved in multiple
  projects related to Natural Language Processing, including as research project
  leader for LEA (LEarning Assistant) to ease the creation of customized chatbots.
  Today he is interested in pushing RL and NLP beyond state of the art and finding
  synergies across these fields, typically towards training adaptive and communicative
  robots. He is collaborating on such topics with other researchers from academia
  and industry in the frame of [ANITI](https://aniti.univ-toulouse.fr/en/) (Artificial and Natural Intelligence Toulouse
  Institute), specialized in mobility/transport and robotic/cobotic applications.
  Alexandre is one of the main contributors to the core of the scikit-decide library
  and to the RL interfaces.<br>

  **Guillaume Povéda** is a research engineer in Airbus Central Research and Technology.
  After an aerospace engineering school, and a research degree in operational research,
  Guillaume has been working for Airbus in various topics involving sequential
  decision-making and scheduling topics. Guillaume has used a wide range of techniques
  to solve complex problems, from classical optimization techniques to more learning
  approaches, which have been published in the ICAPS and CP conferences. Guillaume is
  involved in 2 open source libraries developed by Airbus: scikit-decide as an active
  contributor and [discrete-optimization](https://github.com/airbus/discrete-optimization)
  as main developer, the latter being used as the core scheduling engine in scikit-decide.<br>

  **Sylvie Thiébaux** is a professor of computer science at the Australian National University
  and a directrice de recherche at the University of Toulouse. Her research interests are
  in artificial intelligence, in particular automated planning, scheduling, diagnosis,
  and search, their integration with optimisation, machine learning, and verification,
  as well as their applications to energy and transport. She is the coordinator of the
  European Project [TUPLES](https://tuples.ai/) whose aim is to facilitate the construction of trustworthy
  planning and scheduling systems, which are safe, robust, explainable and scalable.
  Sylvie is a fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence
  (AAAI) and a co-editor in chief of the Artificial Intelligence journal. She is a
  former councilor of AAAI, co-chair and president of the International Conference
  on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS).<br>
