A Hands-On Tutorial on scikit-decide, the Open-Source C++ and Python Library for
Planning, Scheduling and Reinforcement Learning

### Agenda

- **Introduction** (15 mn): General concepts of the library: domains, solvers, spaces, hub, features
- **Part I** (90mn) : Solving domains (aka problems) with auto-selected compatible solvers
   - Notebook I : Solving PDDL problems with classical planning, and reinforcement learning solvers
   - Notebook II : Solving control problems with reinforcement learning, and width-based planning solvers
   - Notebook III : Solving scheduling problems with constraint programming, operation research, and reinforcement learning solvers
- **Part II** (60mn) : Implementing your own domains and solvers
   - Notebook IV : Implementing a scikit-decide domain for RDDL problems
   - Notebook V : Implementing a scikit-decide solver embedding the PROST planner and solving RDDL-based scikit-decide domains
- **Conclusion** (15mn) : Applications, contribution guidelines, and future developments
